configuration, or schema
.SS "Input Options:"
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-timeline\-file\fR FILE
Defines the file to read the driving cycle
from.
.TP
\fB\-\-timeline\-file\fR.skip INT
Skips the firs NUM lines.

\fB\-\-timeline\-file\fR.separator STR
Defines the entry separator.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-netstate\-file\fR FILE
Defines the netstate, route and trajectory
files to read the driving cycles from.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-emission\-class\fR STR
Defines for which emission class the
emissions shall be generated.
.SS "Processing Options:"
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-compute\-a\fR
If set, the acceleration is computed instead
of being read from the file.
.TP
\fB\-\-compute\-a\fR.forward
If set, the acceleration for time t is
computed from v(t+1) \- v(t) instead of v(t)
\- v(t\-1).
.TP
\fB\-\-compute\-a\fR.zero\-correction
If set, the acceleration for time t is set
to 0 if the speed is 0.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-skip\-first\fR
If set, the first line of the read file is
skipped.
.TP
\fB\-\-kmh\fR
If set, the given speed is interpreted as
being given in km/h.
.TP
\fB\-\-have\-slope\fR
If set, the fourth column is read and used
as slope (in deg).
.TP
\fB\-\-slope\fR FLOAT
Sets a global slope (in deg) that is used if
the file does not contain slope information.
.SS "Output Options:"
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR STR
Defines the file to write the emission cycle
results into.
.TP
\fB\-\-emission\-output\fR FILE

Save the aggregated and normed emission
values of each vehicle in CSV
.TP
\fB\-\-write\-license\fR
Include license info into every output file
.TP
\fB\-\-output\-prefix\fR STR
Prefix which is applied to all output files.
The special string 'TIME' is replaced by the
current time.

Defines the number of digits after the comma
for floating point output
.TP
\fB\-\-precision\fR.geo INT
Defines the number of digits after the comma
for lon,lat output
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-human\-readable\-time\fR
